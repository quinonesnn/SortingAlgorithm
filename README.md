Sorting Algorithms Project

Objective:

The objective of this project is to study the effect of implementation language on the sorting algorithms discussed in class and compare them in terms of their runtime complexities.

Project description:

On randomly generated arrays of sizes 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 (and bigger if you will), implement the following algorithms and report the average running times in ns of 1000 runs of each size. Your program should include a test that prints out an array of size 10 before an after it is sorted with every sorting algorithm.

Sorting algorithms

1. Exchange sort (Algorithm 1.3 P.7)

2. Insert Sort (Algorithm 7.1 P.288)

3. Binary Insert Sort (where the binary search is used to determine the correct position of the ith number)

4. Selection Sort (Algorithm 7.2 P.292)

5. Merge sort (Algorithm 2.2 2.3 P. 58, 59)

6. Mergesort2 (Algorithm 2.4 2.5 P. 62, 63)

7. Mergsort4 (Linked list version Algorithm 7.4 P. 300)

8. Quicksort (Algorithm 2.6 2.7 P. 65, 66)

9. Quicksort (using partition algorithm on page 333)

10. Heapsort (algorithm 7.5 P. 304-310)

11. Radix sort (Algorithm 7.6 P. 329, 330)
